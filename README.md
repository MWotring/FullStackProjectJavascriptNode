# FullStackProjectJavascriptNode
Aaalmost done. 
To do: 
- use parsed json data by actually displaying it to the user on the webpage!
- clean up debugging statements
- make user input a little more robust / safe

This project uses an html/css/javascript front end to get a user request for student data. The back end is Node.js and MySQL.
Since it's a local project you'll need to have MySQL and Node.js installed on your system. 
I include a script to set up and populate the database with sample data.
Run the server with ```node NodeServer.js``` 
Then you can request the webpage from the server at ```http://localhost:8080/SearchHome.html```
